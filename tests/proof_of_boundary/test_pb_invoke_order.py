# PB-6 - Invoke-Order Boundary: a full agent.invoke() must execute the fixed
# AgentBaseGraph backbone in order.
#
# The Cat 1 backbone is fixed and is NEVER overridden by a Cat 2 template
# (add_edges() belongs to the framework):
#
#     START -> initialize -> pre_process -> main -> {route} -> post_process
#           -> finalize -> END
#
# The framework records every executed node in `node_history` (an AgentState
# field whose reducer is operator.add, so entries accumulate in execution
# order). Each entry is the node's CLASS NAME - appended by BaseNode.__call__.
#
# For FIN-C2-196 (Cat 2, two-layer nested) the `main` slot is a GraphNode
# subclass (ComplianceAuditGraphNode) that delegates to the inner
# DomainWorkflowGraph. The inner graph runs with its own state; its inner
# node_history is NOT merged back into the outer state (merge_output() maps
# only compliance_answer / result / classification_topic /
# remediation_checklist / citations / status), so the OUTER node_history
# contains exactly the five backbone slots - never the inner domain nodes.
#
# This test drives a real end-to-end Graph().invoke() over the sign-off
# payload and asserts the surfaced node_history matches the canonical backbone
# order. A SUCCESS terminal status is required: on any non-SUCCESS status
# route() short-circuits main -> finalize and the post_process slot is
# skipped, which is itself an invoke-order violation this test would catch.
#
# _VALID_PAYLOAD is READ from deploy/invoke_payload.json at import time (never
# retyped) so byte-equality with the deployment sign-off payload holds by
# construction - no transcription risk on the Japanese / punctuation-heavy
# domain text.
#
# Trust context: InvocationContext(caller_trust_level=TrustLevel.VERIFIED_EXTERNAL)
# - the manifest's declared caller level. for_internal() is NEVER used here:
# it would over-privilege the run and hide trust-gate regressions on the
# outer gate.
#
# docs/03_test_spec.md section 4 (PoB).
# Deterministic - no model call, no network. framework.* / src.* imports only.
